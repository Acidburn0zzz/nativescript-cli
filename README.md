# What is NativeScript
NativeScript is a cross-platform JavaScript framework that lets you develop native iOS and Android apps from a single code base. The framework provides JavaScript access to the native APIs, user interface, and rendering engines of iOS and Android. By using JavaScript or TypeScript, you can create one project that builds into an iOS or Android app with completely native user experience.

To learn more about how to use NativeScript, please follow the [getting started article](http://docs.nativescript.org). To see what commands are available in the CLI, follow the [CLI API docs](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/blob/master/docs/man_pages/index.md).
